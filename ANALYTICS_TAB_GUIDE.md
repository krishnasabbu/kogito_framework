## 🔍 Request/Response Deep Analysis

For EVERY execution, you can now see:

### Request Payload
```json
{
  "customerId": "12345",
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Champion Nodes (Blue)
```
Node: Validate Customer (serviceTask)
Time: 120ms | Status: success

▼ Request (click to expand)
{
  "customerId": "12345"
}

▼ Response (click to expand)
{
  "valid": true,
  "score": 850
}
```

### Challenge Nodes (Green)
```
Node: Validate Customer (serviceTask)
Time: 85ms | Status: success

▼ Request (click to expand)
{
  "customerId": "12345"
}

▼ Response (click to expand)
{
  "valid": true,
  "score": 850
}
```

**Every node shows**:
- Node name and type
- Execution time
- Status (success/error)
- Full request JSON
- Full response JSON

## 💡 Data Analyst Insights

### 1. Performance Trends
**Timeline chart** shows if challenge is:
- Consistently faster
- Getting better over time
- Regressing

### 2. Distribution Analysis
**Histogram** reveals:
- Tight distribution = consistent
- Wide spread = unpredictable
- Outliers visible

### 3. Node Impact Analysis
**Table** answers:
